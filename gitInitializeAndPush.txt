Editing Commits:
3 ways of interacting with commits:
    a. checkout: it shows you a commit of your chosing:
        ex: git checkout "commit code"
            git checkout master //to go to latest commit
    b. revert: it reverts a commit of your choosing in the form of a new commit.
        ex: git revert "commit code" // to confirm revert type :wq
    c. reset: say you have 5 commits and you say reset commit to
    commit 2, it will delete commit 5-3 and make 2 the latest commit.
